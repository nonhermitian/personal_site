I am currently a Principal Research Scientist in the [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/) team at the T. J. Watson research lab in Yorktown Heights New York.  I primarily work in the area of quantum software development, with a focus on numerical methods and scientific visualization techniques.  I also occasionally explore hardware benchmarking and verification, looking at generational system improvement metrics.

I have been working in the area of numerical quantum optics for over 15 years, starting with the creation of [QuTiP : Quantum Toolbox in Python](https://qutip.org) in 2010 up to the present with the IBM [Qiskit SDK](https://qiskit.org).  I received my PhD in 2010 from the [Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.dartmouth.edu/) under [Miles Blencowe](https://physics.dartmouth.edu/people/miles-p-blencowe).  In addition to numerical methods in quantum optics I have also explored quantum nanomechanical systems, optomechanical system in the quantum regime, analogue gravitational physics, and transport models for Hawking radiation.  Prior to joining IBM, I was a Staff Physicist at Northrop Grumman, an Assistant Professor in [Korea University Department of Physics](http://physics.korea.ac.kr/), and a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Franco Nori](https://dml.riken.jp/) at RIKEN just outside of Tokyo.
